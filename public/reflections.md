# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with three to five sentences.

## 1. **Variable Declarations** 
 - Variable declaration is basically how to define a variable based on data type. We could also use words or shortcutted words that are relevant to what the variable is representing. I know this topic very well because of previous knowledge from Grades 7 & 8 and also from Competitive Programming trainings (Reboot).

## 2. **Input and Output Functions**
 - Input and Output Functions are used for codes to collect inputs from the users and project outputs from the computer screen/terminal. There are 4 ways to do it: `console.log`, `alert`, `document.write`, and `document.getElementById`/`id.innerHTML`. I know this topic very well because this is a prerequisite and a basic aspect for being able to code in JavaScript and HTML.

## 3. **Control Statements**
 - Control Statements are used when conditions are needed/implemented into the code. There are 3 basic ways to do it: `if...else`/`if`, `switch`, and loops. I only know `if..else` and `switch` very well because it is a basic control statement that is versatile for almost any CompProg Problem Statement. Loops are still blurry for me though.

## 4. **Relational Operators** 
 - Relational Operators (a.k.a. Comparison Operators) are used to compare indicated values. A few examples of these are: `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, etc. I know this topic very well because these are building blocks for answering Problem Statements and Exercises in class.

## 5. **Logical Operators**
 - Logical Operators are used to connect more than 1 conditional statements. These are the 3 Logical Operators: `&&`, `||`, and `!`. I know this topic very well because it was something we studied and used for C++ during Grade 8. <br><br>

 # List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The "why" should be per topic listed.

 ## 1. **Loop Control Structures**
 - Loop Control Structures are used when you want a block of code to repeat/iterate how many times you want under a condition. These are 3 ways to do it: `while`, `do...while`, and `for`. I really need further practice when using this because I understand how to implement it into my code but I can't visualize what the output of a loop code that's given to me is.

 ## 2. **Functions**
  - Functions are used to execute a certain action and are reusable (can be called again and again). Examples of these are: `alert()`, `prompt()`, and `confirm()`. I really need further practice when using this because it is still confusing for me on how to actually implement it into my code.

 ## 3. **Arrays**
  - Arrays are used to hold multiple values in a single variable. Some reserved words for arrays are: `push`, `pop`, `unshift`, `shift`, etc. I really need further practice and discussion on this topic because I still do not know when to use arrays when needed in a Problem Statement or code.

## 4. **Error Statements**
  - Error Statements are used to detect errors within blocks of code. These are some ways to do so: `catch`, `try`, `finally`, and `throw`. I really need further discussion on this topic because I am still unfamiliar on how to implement it into my code.

## 5. **UTF-8 Letters**
  - UTF-8 Letters are used to stylize a certain word, phrase, or sentence. I really need further practice on this because this involves visual elements. However I feel like I'll only need this when designing websites already. <br><br>

# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

### 1. Study more situations on when to use a specific code.
### 2. Actually code things out to get a grip on how it feels to do a certain code.
### 3. Familiarize reserved words, functions, and statements to have a smoother flow of thoughts when coding. <br><br>

# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

## **Effective**
1. **Kahoot** - These are really effective because it can practice our knowledge on certain topics under time pressure. There is also a factor of fun and achievement when successfully placed on the podium!

2. **Speed Tests** - These are really effective because it tests our knowledge that we've just recently obtained. The bonus points also helps when someone's grade is not that good in other assessments.

## **Not Effective**
1. **Only Discussions** - I prefer discussions and being able to do the code at the same time. Basically interactive sessions.
2. **Graded Exercises** - Graded Exercises are actually good, the only thing is that it's an activity you can bring home. That means other students can use AI or ask help from family members to do it.
